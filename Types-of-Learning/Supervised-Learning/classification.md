## Classification
- classification of test data into specific categories
- examples: seperating apples from orange
- classification tasks can be categorized into several category as stated below.

### Binary Classification
- with 2 class labels, such as true/false, 0/1
- algorithms: logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree, k-Nearest Neighbours

### Multiclass Classification
- with more than 2 class labels
- algorithms: logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree, k-Nearest neighbours, naive Bayes, random forest

### Multilabel Classification
- with 2 or more class labels, where 1 or more labels may be predicted
- e.g. photo classification, where given photo may have multiple objects in the scene
- algorithms: decision tree, random forest

### DIfferent approaches of data classifications
| Class 1 | Class 2 |
|---|---|
| based on dichotomous distinction of classes | based on probability of y given that x |
| [SVM](../Statistical-Model/SVM/svm.md) |  [Logistic regression](../Statistical-Model/Logistic-Regression/logisticRegression.md)<br/> K-nearest neighbors<br/> Decision tree|
