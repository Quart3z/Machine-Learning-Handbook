## Classification
[< supervised learning](../../Introduction.md)

Main objective of classification task is to identify the test data into specific and different classes. The tasks can be divided into several categories as stated below.

### Binary Classification
- with 2 class labels, such as true/false, 0/1
- algorithms: logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree, k-Nearest Neighbours

### Multiclass Classification
- with more than 2 class labels
- algorithms: logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree, k-Nearest neighbours, naive Bayes, random forest

### Multilabel Classification
- with 2 or more class labels, where 1 or more labels may be predicted
- e.g. photo classification, where given photo may have multiple objects in the scene
- algorithms: decision tree, random forest

### DIfferent approaches of data classifications
| Class 1 | Class 2 |
|---|---|
| based on dichotomous distinction of classes | based on probability of y given that x |
| [SVM](SVM/svm.md) |  [Logistic regression](Logistic-Regression/logisticRegression.md)<br/> [k-nearest neighbours](k-Nearest-Neighbours/k-NearestNeighbours.md)<br/> [Decision tree](Decision-Tree/decisionTree.md)|
