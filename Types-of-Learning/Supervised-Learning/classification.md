## Classification
[< supervised learning](../../Introduction.md)

Main objective of classification task is to identify the test data into specific and different classes. The tasks can be divided into several categories as stated below.

 Binary Classification | Multiclass Classification | Multilabel Classification
---|---|---
with 2 class labels, such as true/false, 0/1 | with more than 2 class labels | with 2 or more class labels, where 1 or more labels may be predicted
|logistic regression</br> support vector machine</br> decision tree</br> k-Nearest Neighbours|logistic regression</br> support vector machine</br> decision tree</br> k-Nearest neighbours</br> naive Bayes</br> random forest|decision tree,</br> random forest


### DIfferent approaches of data classifications
| Class 1 | Class 2 |
|---|---|
| based on dichotomous distinction of classes | based on probability of y given that x |
| [SVM](SVM/svm.md) |  [Logistic regression](Logistic-Regression/logisticRegression.md)<br/> [k-nearest neighbours](k-Nearest-Neighbours/k-NearestNeighbours.md)<br/> [Decision tree](Decision-Tree/decisionTree.md)|
