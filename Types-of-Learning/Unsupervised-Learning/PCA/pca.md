- draw the straight line(s) across data to show the highest variance among the data points
- number of principal components = number of dimensions/features in data
---
1. calculate the covariance matrix of data points.
2. calculate the eigenvectors and eigenvalues.
3. sort the eigenvectors in descending order to their eigenvalues.
4. first(largest) k eigenvectors become the new k-dimensions.
5. transform n-dimensional data points into k-dimension.
