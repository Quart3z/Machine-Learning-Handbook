### Binary
- with 2 class labels
- e.g. true/false, 0/1
- algorithms: logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tTree, k-Nearest Neighbours

### Multiclass
- with more than 2 class labels
- algorithms: logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree, k-Nearest neighbours, naive Bayes, random forest

### Multi label
- with 2 or more class labels, where 1 or more labels may be predicted
- e.g. photo classification, where given photo may have multiple objects in the scene
- algorithms: decision tree, random forest
