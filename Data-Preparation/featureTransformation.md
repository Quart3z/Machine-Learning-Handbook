## Feature Transformation

| Normalization (min-max normalization) | Standardization (z-score normalization) |
|---|---|
| scale to the range of 0 - 1| scale to the mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1|
|faster model convergence, improved accuracy|reduce effect of outliner|
|useful in image processing, as to normalized pixel intensities to fit within certain rangel | useful when comparing similarities between features based on certain distance measures|
