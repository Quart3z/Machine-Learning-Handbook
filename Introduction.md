# Introduction
### What is machine learning?
It is considered a field of study concerning techniques driven by statistics to enable computers to learn through experience. Usually seen as a part of artificial intelligence.

### Supervised learning
- defined as uses of labeled datasets on model training
- examples:
    - [Classification](./Types-of-Learning/Supervised-Learning/classification.md)                        
    - [Regression](./Types-of-Learning/Supervised-Learning/regression.md)

### Unsupervised learning
- examples:
    - [Clustering](./Types-of-Learning/Unsupervised-Learning/clustering.md)    
    - [Association](./Types-of-Learning/Unsupervised-Learning/association.md)    
    - [Dimensionality reduction](.Types-of-Learning/Unsupervised-Learning/dimensionalityReduction.md)

### Semi-supervised learning
- mix between supervised and unsupervised learning
- partial labelled data and unlabelled data in dataset
- examples: breast cancer scans
---

### Reinforcement learning
- based on the interactions with the environment
- rewards/failures-based learning method
