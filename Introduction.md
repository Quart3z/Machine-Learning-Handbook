# Introduction
### What is machine learning?
It is considered a field of study concerning techniques driven by statistics to enable computers to learn through experience. Usually seen as a part of artificial intelligence.

### Supervised learning
#### Classification                                  
- classification of test data into specific categories
- binary, multi class, multi label
- SVM, random forest
- examples: seperating apples from orange
#### Regression                                 
- to understand the relationship between dependent and independent variables
- predict numerical values based on given data
- examples: sales revenue prediction

### Unsupervised learning
#### Clustering                                
- grouping unlabeled data based on similarities/differences
- examples: grouping of customer by purchasing behaviour
#### Association                             
- find the relationship between variables and given datasets
- examples: analysis of recommendation engine, recommender system on customer purchase
#### Dimensionality reduction                             
- reduce the number of data inputs to manageable size, while preserving data integrity
- examples: remove noise from visual data

### Semi-supervised learning
- mix between supervised and unsupervised learning
- partial labelled data and unlabelled data in dataset
- examples: breast cancer scans
---

### Reinforcement learning
- based on the interactions with the environment
- rewards/failures-based learning method
