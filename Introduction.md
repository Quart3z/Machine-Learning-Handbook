# Introduction
### What is machine learning?
It is considered a field of study concerning techniques driven by statistics to enable computers to learn through experience. Usually seen as a part of artificial intelligence.

### Supervised learning
Defined as uses of labeled datasets on model training. The model compares the output and the input dataset, while adjusting the weioghts until the model has been fitted properly. [^1]

    - [Regression](./Types-of-Learning/Supervised-Learning/regression.md)

### Unsupervised learning
Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning trained with unlabeled dataset. It discovers the underlying patterns to solve the tasks. The learning method is used when the common properties of the dataset are uncertain. [^2]
- examples:
    - [Clustering](./Types-of-Learning/Unsupervised-Learning/clustering.md)    
    - [Association](./Types-of-Learning/Unsupervised-Learning/association.md)    
    - [Dimensionality reduction](.Types-of-Learning/Unsupervised-Learning/dimensionalityReduction.md)

### Semi-supervised learning
- mix between supervised and unsupervised learning
- partial labelled data and unlabelled data in dataset
- examples: breast cancer scans
---

### Reinforcement learning
- based on the interactions with the environment
- rewards/failures-based learning method
