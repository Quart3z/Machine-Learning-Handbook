## Variance and bias
Variance
- value of changes based on different training dataset

Bias 
- Difference between average prediction value of the model and the actual value

Bias - variacne tradeoff
- Increasing the bias reduce the variance, increasing the variance reduce the bias

---
|Overfitting|Underfitting|
|--|--|
|High variance among the prediction results|High bias value between the prediction value and actual value
Fits the training data too well | Cannot learn from trained data
Noise and small fluctuation learned as concepts by the model | Failed to generalize data
High train accuracy, low validation accuracy | Low train accuracy and validation accuracy | 
Train with more data | Increase model complexity
Remove irrelevant features | Increase feature
Early stopping | Increase epochs or duration of training
Regularizations:</br> - L1 (Lasso) Regularization</br> - L2 (Ridge) Regularization| Decrease/remove regularization
